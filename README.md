Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris contains a lot of gear that you can collect. I wanted to know which ones were worth hunting down. A lot of items obsolete other items, and I'm not in the mood to sift through them manually, so... I wrote this.

I got the dataset from here: http://tombraiders.net/stella/walks/LCTOOwalk/items.html
